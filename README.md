# Student-Management-System-OOP
This project is a CLI-based (Command Line Interface) application designed to manage student records, course enrollments, and grades using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system supports adding students and courses, enrolling students in courses, assigning grades, and viewing detailed information about students and courses. Additionally, it provides the capability to save and load data using JSON file operations, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

Key Features:

Add New Student: Register a student with essential details like name, age, address, and a unique student ID.
Create New Course: Set up courses with attributes like course name, code, and instructor.
Enroll in Courses: Enroll students into courses using their student ID and course code.
Assign Grades: Add or update student grades for specific courses.
Display Details: View comprehensive information for both students (including enrolled courses and grades) and courses (with lists of enrolled students).
File Operations: Save and load data seamlessly for continued use after restarting the program.
Error Handling: Robust checks ensure valid operations, like confirming student enrollment before adding grades.
Intended Audience: This project is ideal for developers and educators looking to manage student and course records programmatically. Itâ€™s also a helpful resource for learners aiming to understand how to implement OOP concepts in Python through a practical, real-world application.
